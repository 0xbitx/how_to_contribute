## Contributing to Your Friend's School Project on GitHub

You and your friend are both students who share a passion for technology. Your friend has been working on a school projectâ€”a simple web app that helps students manage their homework assignments. Theyâ€™ve uploaded the project to GitHub and mentioned that they could use some help adding new features and fixing a few bugs.

Although youâ€™re not professional software developers, you both enjoy learning about coding and want to collaborate on this project to improve your skills. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide on how to contribute to your friend's project:

## 1. Fork the Repository
Go to the GitHub repository you want to contribute to.
Click the "Fork" button at the top-right of the repository page. This will create a copy of the repository under your own GitHub account.

## 2. Clone Your Fork
Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
```
Replace your-username with your GitHub username and repository-name with the name of the repository.
## 3. Set Up the Upstream Remote

  After cloning, navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd repository-name
```
Add the original repository as an upstream remote. This allows you to pull in changes from the original repository to keep your fork up-to-date:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/friend-username/repository-name.git
```

Replace friend-username with your friend's GitHub username.
## 4. Create a New Branch

Before making any changes, create a new branch where you will work on your contributions. This keeps your changes isolated from the main branch:

```bash
git checkout -b my-feature-branch
```

Replace my-feature-branch with a descriptive name for your branch that indicates the work you are doing.
## 5. Make Your Changes

  Edit, add, or delete files as necessary to make your contribution.
  You can check the status of your changes with:

```bash
git status
```
Add your changes to the staging area:

```bash
git add .
```
Commit your changes with a descriptive message:

```bash
git commit -m "Add a new feature that does XYZ"
```

## 6. Push Your Branch to GitHub

   Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub:

```bash
git push origin my-feature-branch
```

## 7. Create a Pull Request

Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
You should see a prompt to create a pull request for the branch you just pushed.
Click "Compare & pull request."
Write a descriptive title and comment for your pull request, explaining what changes you've made and why they should be merged.
Submit the pull request.

## 8. Respond to Feedback
The repository maintainers (your friend, in this case) might request changes or provide feedback.
You can make additional commits to your branch to address any feedback and push them to GitHub. These changes will automatically be reflected in your pull request.

## 9. Keep Your Fork Up-to-Date
While waiting for your pull request to be reviewed, you should keep your fork up-to-date with the upstream repository:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
```
If there are updates, you might need to rebase your branch or resolve conflicts before your changes can be merged.

## 10. Celebrate Your Contribution!

Once your pull request is reviewed and merged, your contribution will be part of the main project. ðŸŽ‰

This process ensures that your contributions are organized and that the original project remains stable and manageable.
